# Climatology Py Dash

Generate climatologies for NERACOOS data on the fly, based on what is avaliable on the Mariner's Dashboard.

This is built with [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) which is a hybrid notebook and app framework to allow rapid iteration and then a Streamlit-like experiance.

## Commands

- `pixi run edit` - Opens Marimo notebooks in the browser for editing.
- `pixi run app` - Runs the app in the browser in a non-editable mode.
